## Synopsis

Howstr writes instructions for you.

Howstr will write and update complicated project documentation such as instructions and bills of material so that you can work with others more efficiently. You write what you know one time in one place and leave everything else to Howstr. 

## Installation

Ultimately Howstr is more of a solution than a product. The alpha prototype has verified the concept as a desktop application and that's what will be developed going forward. There will be a version optimized for web (no local access, but lots of processing power) and a version optimized for mobile (tiny screens, but lots of sensors).

To run the Howstr Alpha prototype as a desktop application:
- Get the appropriate version for your OS in the [Howstr_Alpha folder](https://github.com/matthewmaier/howstr/tree/master/Howstr_Alpha).

To run Howstr from the Livecode IDE:
- Download the community (open source) version of [Livecode (version 8, highest DP)](http://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/)
- Install Livecode
- Open the "howstr_alpha.livecode" stack

You can open the example files or build networks from scratch. Howstr automatically produces Instructions and calculates Resources. 

## Contributors

All participation welcome! I self-taught [Livecode](http://www.livecode.com) so that I could get this prototype built and verify the idea. There's a ton I don't know and a lot of stuff I'm skipping over.
