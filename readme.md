## Synopsis

Howstr manipulates the NotionAll documentation schema. This GUI makes it easy to understand and edit a network (nodes and links) of snippets of information. Ultimately you can manage all of the files relevant to a project (how to turn something into something else) using Howstr and collaborate with someone through the internet. 

## Code Example

I'll come up with a good example later.

## Motivation

I want to collaborate on hardware projects with other people wherever they happen to be. That's easier to do on software projects because computers follow instructions perfectly. In a hardware project the human is the compiler, so it's harder to write the instructions. If we can make it easy to discover and replicate tangible things we can extend the benefits of open source to everything outside of the computer.

## Installation

To run Howstr as a standalone:
Get the appropriate desktop application for your OS in the Howstr_Alpha folder.

To run Howstr from the Livecode IDE:
Download the community (open source) version of Livecode (version 8, highest DP) http://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/
Open the "howstr alpha.livecode" stack in the IDE

## API Reference

No API yet. You can help with that.

## Tests

Also no tests. Definitely help with that.

## Contributors

All participation welcome! I self-taught so that I could get this prototype built and validate the idea. There's a ton I don't know and a lot of stuff I'm skipping over. Ultimately I think this could become a standard with a big community developing and using it for all sorts of instructions.

## License

Apache 2.0 Using Howstr will make the world better. I don't see any reason to place restrictions on usage.
