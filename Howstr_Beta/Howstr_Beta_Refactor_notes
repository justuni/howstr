ISSUES
- Howstr Alpha only handled one graph, Beta needs to handle many
-- sNowDoc isn't flexible enough
-- the display will send many queries to the backend, mapped to various windows
- use groups to manage the display images
- sMain[0][hide]=true
-- probably don't need that; I think it was for rTree
- sMain[4][coord]=500,10
-- probably don't need this tag anymore since layout is handled automatically
- sMain[doc][rec][tag]=data/pointer
-- can record the path & file of origin in metadata
-- but would be more straight forward to use those as keys
-- sMain[path][file][doc][rec][tag]=data/pointer
-- that would be the entire pointer; wouldn't require a lookup table or search
- in grapherrific, topoSort calls "get kahnSort"
-- kahnSort is a function, but doesn't return anything
-- "get" is putting the function kahnSort into the "it" variable
-- can kahnSort just be a command and not be called with "get"?
- tracking data>logic>display
-- consistent address is path/file/doc/rec/tag
-- so there are windows, and possibly "areas" within each window
-- map those to the data, affects queries and answers
-- each area makes its own independent query
-- logic answers each query and returns to area's address
-- ? update to one area should push changes to other areas
-- at the moment each query can be handled one at a time
-- in the future they can go into a list and a service will respond
- many documents, files, and paths
-- when they crosspoint each other, a query will ask for info in more than one
-- graph logic should have a thread for each query, bounded by its parameters/address
-- should push # of changes to requesting area, so area can prompt user to refresh
- preview
-- needs more graphics
-- create and delete preview graphics?
-- logic for Howstr action groups is more complicated
- consolidate data into fewer variables
- spread out logic
-- the logic related to different NotionAll relationships is important
-- but it's importance is spread out in a lot of different places
-- need to be able to draw on some central data/logic
-- which makes the important distinctions
- pre-process or process on-demand
-- some aspects of display depend on graph details
-- ex: preview logic depends on two nodes abutting or not
-- calc that data ahead of time for all possible nodes?
-- or allow preview logic to query graph logic?
- graph change request syntax
-- need to be able to package many related requests
-- also distinguish these pointers from existing pointers
array[a][from]=user
array[a][type]=flow
array[a][backward]=#
array[a][forward]=#
array[#][something] (will replace step # details with new details)
array[#][hide]=true (will wide step #)
- basically there's no benefit to multiple different arrays
-- display info needs almost full graph data for preview & change requests
