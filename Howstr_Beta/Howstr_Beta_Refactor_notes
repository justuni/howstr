ISSUES
- Howstr Alpha only handled one graph, Beta needs to handle many
-- sNowDoc isn't flexible enough
-- the display will send many queries to the backend, mapped to various windows
- use groups to manage the display images
- sMain[0][hide]=true
-- probably don't need that; I think it was for rTree
- sMain[4][coord]=500,10
-- probably don't need this tag anymore since layout is handled automatically
- sMain[doc][rec][tag]=data/pointer
-- can record the path & file of origin in metadata
-- but would be more straight forward to use those as keys
-- sMain[path][file][doc][rec][tag]=data/pointer
-- that would be the entire pointer; wouldn't require a lookup table or search
