# Howstr Roadmap

## Alpha
Backend worked. Frontend worked well enough to test backend.

## Beta
- Implement "quick mode", interface optimized for noob user speed
- Move as much code as possible into text stacks
- Organize application in a sensible way
- End result is a demo or MVP that's been tested by users
